# Unreal Engine StateTree AI system

AI system in Unreal Engine 5.2 using State Trees. I personally like this approach much more than behavior trees.
The system is universal, so it should be easy to change different animations and behavior across characters.

There is just one template character, that walks to random location and then attacks player. 
If player guards with shield AI will react and stop the attack. AI can combo its attack, once it finishes attack 1, there is 50% it will follow with another one from different direction. These attacks can be easily changed by changing anim montages.

I will expand on this with more enemies and include procedural world, probably as a branch. //will update this later


Enjoy!
